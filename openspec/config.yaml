  # Silver Tasks CLI - Personal Task Manager

  ## Purpose
  A command-line task management tool designed for university students and personal productivity.
  Optimized for quick task entry and prioritized viewing of deadlines across multiple subjects/categories.

  ## Domain Context
  - Primary users: University students managing coursework across multiple subjects
  - Secondary use: Personal tasks, plans tracking, miscellaneous to-dos
  - User environment: OpenSUSE Linux, terminal-driven workflow
  - Design philosophy: Minimize keystrokes, maximize clarity, keyboard-first interface

  ## Tech Stack
  - Language: Rust 1.85+ (Rust 2021 edition)
  - CLI Framework: clap v4 (derive API for subcommands)
  - Serialization: serde + serde_json
  - Date/Time: chrono
  - Storage: Local JSON file persistence
  - Output formatting: Table-based display (comfy-table or similar)

  ## Binary Installation
  - Binary name: silver-tasks
  - Install to: ~/.local/bin/ (for personal use)
  - Development: Test with 'cargo run -- <subcommand>' (no installation needed)

  ## Architecture Principles
  - Modular design: Separate concerns (models, storage, commands, UI)
  - Single responsibility: Each module handles one aspect
  - Persistence strategy: File-based storage in user's home directory
  - Command pattern: Subcommands for different operations

  ## Code Conventions
  - Error handling: Use anyhow::Result<T> for ergonomic error propagation
  - Data structures: Derive Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize for all models
  - Date handling: Use chrono types (NaiveDate, DateTime<Local>)
  - Code style: Follow rustfmt defaults and clippy recommendations
  - Testing: Write unit tests for business logic, integration tests for CLI

  ## Module Organization Pattern
  - src/main.rs: CLI entry point and argument parsing
  - src/models.rs: Core data structures
  - src/storage.rs: Persistence layer abstraction
  - src/commands/: Console command processing, one file per command (or major command group)
  - Separate concerns: Keep I/O, business logic, and UI separate

  ## Output Design Principles
  - Tabular display for list views
  - Human-readable date formats
  - Consistent ID representation across all commands
  - Clear, actionable error messages

rules:
  proposal:
    - Keep proposals focused on a single capability area
    - Include motivation explaining user value
    - Specify impact on existing features

  tasks:
    - Break into 30-60 minute implementation chunks
    - Order by dependency (models → storage → logic → UI)
    - Each task should be independently testable

  spec:
    - Use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format for all scenarios
    - Include realistic examples (actual subject names, dates)
    - Specify exact CLI syntax for command scenarios
    - Define both success and error cases
